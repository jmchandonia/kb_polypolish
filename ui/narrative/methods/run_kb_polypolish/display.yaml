description : |
    <p>This is a KBase wrapper for <a href="https://github.com/rrwick/polypolish">Polypolish, a tool for short-read polishing of long-read assemblies</a>. Long-read-only bacterial genome assemblies usually contain residual errors, most commonly homopolymer-length errors.  These can be fixed with short read polishing.  Polypolish uses all-per-read alignments to repair errors in repeat sequences that other polishers cannot.

    <p>More details on Polypolish can be found in publication [1] at the bottom of this App detail page.
